# Frequently Asked Questions - Graduate Programs

The following is a collection of frequently asked questions and answers about the graduate programs of CAS. Please note that the following are **not** regulations but a list of clarifications and best practices.

##### Q: Who maintains this FAQ? Can I suggest changes to it?
This FAQ is maintained by the Graduate Curriculum and Policy Committee (GCPC). Changes to the regulations can be suggested ... ***TODO: how. This will depend on where we store this document. I'd recommend a mechanism that's similar to GH's fork-and-PR, so that everyone can draft FAQ items and the GCPC can approve those changes easily + reword them and curate the FAQ.***

## Regulations

##### Q: Who maintains the regulations? Can I suggest changes to it?
The regulations are maintained by the Graduate Curriculum and Policy Committee (GCPC). Changes to the regulations can be suggested to the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies, i.e., the Chair of the GCPC (currently: Dr. Jacques Carette). The GCPC will investigate these suggestions if deemed relevant by the Chair and prepare a proposal to the Department. Evantually, it is the Department that has to approve changes with simple majority.

##### Q: Where do I find the regulations?
The current regulations are available here:

- MEng: https://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/cas/0files/archive_reg/reg_meng_cs.pdf TODO: validate this with Jacques

##### Q: What is the Graduate Student Handbook?
The Graduate Student Handbook is an all-in-one guide to helpful information for graduate students and other researchers in the Department. It includes department-specific and general information. It is available here: https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/app/uploads/2024/08/2024-25_CAS_GradHandbook_Useful_Info_Updated.pdf.

**TODO: explain that the grad handbook is binding/contractual**


**TODO: Regarding the Q&A below, it is unclear which of these answers are relevant to which of the degrees (SE/CS, masters/PhD)**

## Supervisory meetings

##### Q: What is a supervisory meeting?
...***TODO Istvan: quote from the regulations***

##### Q: What is the typical format of the supervisory meeting?
...***TODO Istvan: student gives account of progress, committee member(s) assess and ask clarifying questions***

##### Q: What is the typical format of the student presentation?
A useful template is available here: [GradCommitteeMeeting-Template.pptx](GradCommitteeMeeting-Template.pptx).
**TODO: This template (especially the later parts) is very engineering oriented. Perhaps it would be good to qualify this example**


##### Q: What happens after the supervisory meeting?
...***TODO Istvan: explain paperwork and give pointer to the PDF file (or Stefanie, if don't want to fix the link here)***

## Comprehensive examinations

##### Q: What is a comprehensive examination?
...***TODO Istvan: two parts (related questions in the next sections)***...

##### Q: Who can chair the examination?
The Chair is a member of the supervisory committee (who is not a supervisor) and should be settled ahead of the defense.

##### Q: Who assigns the Chair?
...the GCPC chair assigns the comps chair (***TODO check with Jacques: is this true for both Part I and Part II?***)
...TODO: process -- who should ask the GCPC chair to appoint a chair? ***TODO check with Jacques***


##### Q: What is the role of the chair?
- The role of the chair is to ensure that the process is followed properly (but also that no one is being overly aggressive in their questions, and that the questioning seems to be thorough; if the student never answers “I don’t know” to a question, it’s probably not thorough enough.) The Chair may ask questions, but is not expected to. It would be improper for the Chair to ask “tough” questions.

***TODO check with Jacques: is this the same as in Part II? Cf. this part here:***

- The role of the chair is to conduct the examination, fill in the paperwork, but also to ask questions (with no restrictions); the usual order of questioning is 1) the ‘other’ member(s) of the supervisory committee, 2) the chair, 3) the supervisor(s). However, the committee can settle on any order they wish, as long as they do it ahead of the examination.


### Comps - Part I

##### Q: What is the purpose of Part I?
The purpose is to test student’s “readiness to do research” in their ‘large’ topic. This is meant to be done by asking them to do a literature review around a topic under the same umbrella as their own topic, but separate from it. The supervisory committee as a whole has to approve that the Comp I topic is appropriate [the supervisor doesn’t have to come up with the topic, it can come from anyone on the committee.]



##### Q: What happens before the examination?
- The committee typically gives the students a few papers as a starting point for a literature review. (TODO: review, scoping, or synthesis? Let's discuss this because these terms are ambiguous.)
- The report should be roughly 20 pages long (say, in LIPICS format; LNCS is too short, IEEE / ACM 2 column way too long), not counting references. Appendices are allowed, but committee members do not have to read them.

##### Q: What is the typical format of the examination?
- The student presentation is limited to 20 minutes.
- The committee is within its purview to question the student on the ‘fundamentals’ under the given topic, to ascertain if the student has a solid grounding on which to build on.

##### Q: What should the written and oral reports demonstrate?
- The written report should demonstrate that the student has done a literature search, i.e. has gone beyond the papers given as a starting point.
- The written report should contain a (very short section on) some “open questions” in the domain of the report.
- The oral report should demonstrate that the student has understood the papers, individually and as a whole, i.e. have done some synthesis.

##### Q: What are the potential outcomes of the examination?
Any part of the examination (i.e. report, oral, both) can be failed and repeated. It can only be repeated a single time.
 

### Comps - Part II (Thesis proposal)

##### Q: What is the purpose of Part II?
This examination is intended to ensure that the student understands both the theoretical and practical issues in the research area, and that they are well prepared to carry out the research described in the thesis proposal.

##### Q: What happens before the examination?
The candidate prepares a thesis proposal.
- The proposal should include a clear definition of the intended research problem(s), a careful survey of previous related  work, discussion of the methodology to be used, and a timetable.
- The proposal should be 20-30 pages in length (rest as above), given to the committee 4 weeks before the examination. Ahead of the examination, the supervisory committee may say that the report is not ready to be defended and ask for it to be improved before a examination is scheduled; concrete, actionable and constructive criticism must be given to allow the student to perform these changes.

##### Q: Are results needed at this point?
- No, there is no need for any results to have been obtained before a part II is defended. The committee's goal is to help steer the candidate's work *before* they undertake the actual research. (Having too many results already could be taken as a failure on the supervisory committee’s part to have timed things properly.)

##### Q: What is the typical format of the examination?
- The student presentation is limited to 20 minutes.
- The examination typically takes two hours in total.
- As the examination is supposed to be public, members of the public may also have questions. These are asked at the end, and the chair may limit them to 15 minutes.

##### Q: What should the written and oral reports demonstrate?
- The proposal should demonstrate that successful pursuance of the research will yield a substantial contribution to the body of knowledge of Computer Science / Software Engineering.

##### Q: What are the potential outcomes of the examination?
***TODO check with Jacques***
